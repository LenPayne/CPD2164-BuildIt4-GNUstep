# CPD-2164 Build It Samples for Lesson #11
## Classes and Properties

This repo contains samples for a lesson based on classes and properties in Objective-C.

This includes both starting files, and ending files.

To run either as-is, run the `./run.sh` script. You may need to run `chmod 755 run.sh` first.

To complete the exercise, you will need to create a Car class (eg- Car.m and Car.h). A slight 
modification needs to be made to run.sh: the Car.m file must be added to the `gcc` command.
